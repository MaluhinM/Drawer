The basic default control is shown below, without any changes in the program settings.
The keys or key combination are written in angle brackets ('<' and '>').
On the contrary, the action that the program must perform when using a particular key or combination of keys is indicated.
The mini-game has the following features:

- Basic movement:
-> Is performed by pressing the buttons: <w>, <a>, <s>, <d>. Where ...
--> <w> - Forward movement
--> <a> - Move to the left
--> <s> - Moving backwards
--> <d> - Move to the right

- Moving with the Shift key pressed:
-> The same keys are used as for the main movement, but with the Shift key additionally pressed

- Moving with the Ctrl key pressed:
-> The same keys are used as for the main movement, but with the Ctrl key additionally pressed

- Other functions:
-> <Esc> - Program shutdown
-> <Del> (<Delete>) - Cleaning
-> <Tab> - Raising/lowering the 'pen'
-> <Ctrl + z> - Cancel the operation
-> <F12> - Reset the rotation parameter (Reset the direction)

- The program also uses 'shapes', which are internal mutable algorithms of the program.
They perform a certain sequence of actions, which is usually aimed at drawing certain shapes.
You can create shapes yourself, but the program already has 2 by default:
-> <1> - Circle
-> <2> - Snowflake
