Brief instructions for using the mini-game.
The main program is started by the file 'Minigame -2024.exe'.
The management is specified in the file 'Control.txt'.
If you want to look at the program from the command line, you should run the file 'console.exe'.

Details:
The file 'Minigame -2024.exe' runs the main algorithm of the program, which uses the following files\folders:
-> <figures.py> stores algorithms of 'shapes' that can be called by certain keys or keyboard shortcuts.
-> <__pycache__> - a folder that stores a cache for reading information about algorithms from a file <figures.py>.
-> <data> is the main folder with information for the operation of the program, which is also a folder for configuring the program.

There is also a program in the files <CreateNewFigure.exe> to simplify the creation of 'shapes' (algorithms).
If you do not know the Python programming language and do not understand the essence of creating shapes, it is better not to use this program.
