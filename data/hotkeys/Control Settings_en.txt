The <hotkeys> folder contains hotkeys for working with the program.
If necessary, the parameter values can be changed.
To change the parameters, you need to enter the keyboard shortcut you need into a specific text file.
Depending on the selected file, a certain parameter will change.
The list of default parameters is shown at the bottom:

The <base> folder contains files responsible for the usual movement of the Turtle performer in the program:
forward - forward movement (w)
backward - backward movement (s)
left - turn left by 90° (a)
right - turn right by 90° (d)

The <shift> folder contains files responsible for movement using the Shift key:
shift_forward - enhanced forward movement (Shift + w)
shift_backward - enhanced backward movement (Shift + s)
shift_left - 45° left turn (Shift + a)
shift_right - 45° right turn (Shift + d)

The <ctrl> folder contains files responsible for movement using the Ctrl key:
ctrl_forward - weak forward movement (Ctrl + w)
ctrl_backward - weak backward movement (Ctrl + s)
ctrl_left - turn left by 5° (Ctrl + a)
ctrl_right - turn right by 5° (Ctrl + d)

The <figures> folder contains files responsible for drawing certain shapes by the performer:
figure_circle - circle (1)
figure_snowflake - snowflake (2)

The <other> folder contains files responsible for other features of the program:
exit - shutdown of the program (Esc)
clear - reset the canvas (Del)
reset_heading - reset the rotation of the performer (F12)
undo - cancel the action (Ctrl + z)
pen - raising/lowering the performer's "pen" (Tab)

Please note that if you specify an invalid key value,
the program will refuse to work and notify you of this with a window indicating an error.
To fix the problem, roll back the changes to their original appearance.
The universal method of solving problems is to reinstall the program.
