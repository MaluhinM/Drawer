The <values> folder stores the values on which the behavior of the program depends.
If necessary, the parameter values can be changed.
To change the parameters, you need to enter the value you need in a specific text file.
Depending on the selected file, a certain parameter will change.
The list of default parameters is shown at the bottom:

The <base> folder contains files responsible for the usual movement of the Turtle performer in the program:
forward - moving forward (10)
backward - move backwards (10)
left - turn left by 90° (90)
right - turn right by 90° (90)

The <shift> folder contains files responsible for movement using the Shift key:
shift_forward - enhanced forward movement (20)
shift_backward - enhanced backward movement (20)
shift_left - 45° left turn (45)
shift_right - 45° right turn (45)

The <ctrl> folder contains files responsible for movement using the Ctrl key:
ctrl_forward - weak forward movement (1)
ctrl_backward - weak backward movement (1)
ctrl_left - turn left by 5° (5)
ctrl_right - turn right by 5° (5)

The <figures> folder contains folders with names of shapes, inside which there are files responsible for drawing certain shapes by the performer:
<figure_circle> - circle
 {figure_circle} - radius of the circle (10)
<figure_snowflake> - snowflake
 {figure_snowflake, - number of repetitions (4)
forward, - forward movement (20)
backward, - backward movement (20)
left, - left turn by 45° (45)
right} - right turn by 45° (45)

The <other> folder contains files in which the value 1 is enabled, 0 (or other characters) is disabled. By default, everything is enabled:
exit - shutdown of the program (1)
clear - reset the canvas (1)
reset_heading - reset the rotation of the performer (1)
undo - undo action (1)
pen - raising/lowering the "handle" of the performer (1)

Please note that if an invalid value is specified in the files,
the program will refuse to work and notify you of this with a window indicating an error.
To fix the problem, roll back the changes to their original appearance.
The universal method of solving problems is to reinstall the program.
